Source code for One Night at Tux's (as it was known before it was renamed right before release).

To compile this for your native OS you need to run `cargo build --release`. `cargo appimage` can be used to distribute the AppImage. 

You may need to modify the Raylib source code to get it to compile due to a function name conflict. Sorry!
