Source code for One Night at Tux's (as it was known before it was renamed right before release).

The code here is VERY bad. I could probably fix it up in a day if I ever felt like it, but I probably won't).

Requires Raylib and Rust. After installing both, run `cargo build` in the terminal to build in debug mode or `cargo build --release` to build in release mode (or swap `build` for `run` to build and run the program instantly).
